Post-Newtonian expansion of gravitational energy and angular momentum fluxes: inclined spherical orbits about a Kerr black hole (2025)

This repository contains the expansions of the gravitational energy and angular momentum fluxes for Kerr EMRIs with inclined-spherical orbits to 12PN. The expressions are closed in inclination parameter x at each PN order. The series can be loaded using Mathematica's Get[] function, with a guide for importation provided in the loadSeries.nb notebook.
